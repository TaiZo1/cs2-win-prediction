# BAS Project - Advanced Statistical Learning

**Status**: Not started. BAD project must be completed first.

---

## Overview

This folder will contain the second phase of the CS2 economic analysis project, focusing on advanced modeling techniques covered in the BAS (Bases de l'Apprentissage Statistique) course.

**Timeline**: Spring 2025 (next semester)

---

## Planned scope

Building on the dataset and exploratory analysis from the BAD project:

- Advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso)
- Kernel methods and non-linear modeling
- Neural networks for prediction
- Model deployment considerations

---

## Prerequisites

Complete BAD project first:
- Clean dataset in `../bad/data/processed/`
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
- Baseline model performance benchmarks

---

## Current status

This project will begin after completing:
1. BAD exploratory analysis
2. BAD baseline models (KNN, Logistic Regression)
3. BAD final report

Check `../bad/` for current work.
